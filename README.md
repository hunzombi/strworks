# strworks
# This module is about working with strings.
# At the moment there are only 2 features:
1. Makepattern - it is a class which stores the pattern.                                                                
1.1 search - checks if the pattern is in a string.
#
# Syntax:
1.Makepattern(pattern) the pattern needs to be a string SPECIAL CHARACTERS: /d - can be any integer, /s - can be any character(str)
1.1.search(text) - check for the pattern in the text.
